Hello, my name is Paulo, but my friends call me Lete, so you can do so as well.

I'm a university student, currently enrolled in Aerospatial Engineering.
Coding is, however, my true passion, so I try to practice it as much as I can.

My main interests are algorithm design and AI development, although I'm still developing the algorithms.
Currently working in sorting and search ones!

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone who cares enough to dedicate some time to a still-learning student.
I must say that I learn quick and never cease to be amazed with all the things that can be programmed :).
Note that I only have an advanced language knowledge in Python (for the time being...), yet I also manage to get some work done with C, JS and MatLab.

You can reach me through szblzpaulo@gmail.com, and feel free to check any of my projects. Have a nice day!
