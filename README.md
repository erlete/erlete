# Hey there!

Hello, my name is Paulo, but everybody calls me Lete. I'm a Computer Engineering student in Spain and no, I cannot hack your ex's Facebook account.

## Interests

**I really, _really_ like coding**, as you can see in my GitHub profile. I've developed several projects ranging from simple progress bars to complete search algorithms playgrounds. My main goal is to explore computer science in a nice, interesting way.

I'm currently part of a **Formula Student team** where we develop an Autonomous Driving System for a formula student car (tinier than F1, but equally cool).

## Development skills

I've got a professional-ish level in **Python** programming. In fact, this was the first language I learned back in 2020. I can do almost anything with it, from data processing to API services management.

Since I'm a fan of UNIX-based systems, **bash** and **zsh** are fundamental languages for me as well. I can develop complex scripts in bash, yet I can never remember how to remove a file extension from a file name. That's sad, I know.

I also have some experience with languages such as **Java**, **JavaScript** (yes, I know they are not the same), **C** or **C++**, having developed some minor projects with them, but I must say I'm not a big fan of semicolons.

On a different line, I use **Unreal Engine** to develop 3D virtual reality environments, mainly for product showcase purposes.

## Other skills

Some say I'm a good leader, others say I'm not, but one thing is for sure: **I know how to work in a team**. I believe communication is the standard requirement for successful teamwork, and I make a good job encouraging this good practice.

Furthermore, despite being from Spain, I speak English on a decent level (**I currently have got a C1 language certificate**).
